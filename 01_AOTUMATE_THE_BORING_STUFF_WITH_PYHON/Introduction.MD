“You’ve just done in two hours what it takes the three of us two days to do.”
你用两个小时就干完了我们三个人要花费两天才能完成的任务.

My college roommate was working at a retail electronics store in the early 2000s. 

Occasionally, the store would receive a spreadsheet(电子表格) of 
thousands of product prices from its competitor(竞争者).

A team of three employees would print the spreadsheet onto a thick stack of paper(厚厚的一摞纸) 
and split it among themselves. 

For each product price, they would look up their store’s price
and note all the products that their competitors sold for less. 
It usually took a couple of days.

“You know, I could write a program to do that if you have the original file(原始文件) for the printouts,” 
my roommate told them, when he saw them sittingon(无名指) the floor with papers scattered(散落一地) 
and stacked(堆积) around them.

After a couple of hours, he had a short program that read a competitor’s price from a file, 
found the product in the store’s database, and noted whether the competitor was cheaper. 

He was still new to programming, and he spent most of his time looking up documentation in a programming book.

The actual program took only a few seconds to run. 
My roommate and his co-workers took an extra-long lunch that day.

This is the power of computer programming. 
A computer is like a Swiss Army knife(瑞士军刀) that you can configure for countless tasks. 
Many people spend hours clicking and typing to perform repetitive tasks, 
unaware that the machine they’re using could do their job in seconds 
if they gave it the right instructions(指令).

whom is this Book for?

Software is at the core of so many of the tools we use today: 
Nearly everyone uses social networks to communicate, 
many people have Internet-connected computers in their phones, 
and most office jobs(办公室工作) involve interacting with a computer(涉及与电脑的互动) to get work done. 

As a result, the demand for people who can code has skyrocketed(编程人员的需求量暴涨). 
Countless books, interactive web tutorials(交互式网络教程), 
and developer boot camps(培训机构) promise to turn ambitious beginners(野心勃勃的初学者) into software engineers 
with six-figure salaries(6位数的薪水).

This book is not for those people. It’s for everyone else.

On its own(就其本身而言), this book won’t turn you into a professional software devel-oper any more 
than a few guitar lessons will turn you into a rock star(几节吉他课将你变成摇滚明星). 

But if you’re an office worker, administrator, academic(大学生), or anyone else 
who uses a computer for work or fun, you will learn the basics of programming 
so that you can automate simple tasks such as the following:

    •  Moving and renaming thousands of files and sorting them into folders()
    •  Filling out online forms, no typing required
    •  Downloading files or copy text from a website whenever it updates
    •  Having your computer text you custom notifications
    •  Updating or formatting Excel spreadsheets(更新或者是格式化你的Excel表格)
    •  Checking your email and sending out prewritten responses(预先写好的答复)
These tasks are simple but time-consuming(简单却耗时) for humans, 
and they’re often so trivial or specific that there’s no ready-made software to perform them. 
(如此繁琐或者是特别,但却没有现成的软件来完成他们)
Armed with(拥有) a little bit of programming knowledge, you can have your computer do these tasks for you.
