“You’ve just done in two hours what it takes the three of us two days to do.”



My college
roommate was working at a retail electronics
store in the early 2000s. Occasionally, the store
would receive a spreadsheet of thousands of product
prices from its competitor. A team of three employees
would print the spreadsheet onto a thick stack of paper and split it among
themselves. For each product price, they would look up their store’s price
and note all the products that their competitors sold for less. It usually took
a couple of days.
“You know, I could write a program to do that if you have the original
file for the printouts,” my roommate told them, when he saw them sitting
on the floor with papers scattered and stacked around them.
After a couple of hours, he had a short program that read a competitor’s price from a file, found the product in the store’s database, and noted
whether the competitor was cheaper. He was still new to programming, and

he spent most of his time looking up documentation in a programming
book. The actual program took only a few seconds to run. My roommate
and his co-workers took an extra-long lunch that day.
This is the power of computer programming. A computer is like a Swiss
Army knife that you can configure for countless tasks. Many people spend
hours clicking and typing to perform repetitive tasks, unaware that the
machine they’re using could do their job in seconds if they gave it the right
instructions.
